It's been a little while now since I started contributing to PowerShell Core,
so I thought it's probably an apt time to talk about it a little bit.
I've come to the conclusion that sooner or later, we should probably _all_ look to see if we can
contribute anything to whichever tools we happen to be using.
After all, there really is no one better suited to guide the development of the tools _you're using_
on a daily basis than **you**.
I'll try to break down why I think we should all look to contribute a little something back to the
tools we use in our day-to-day lives wherever we can.

Developers often have their own ideas for where the project is headed, and that's fantastic &mdash;
having a concrete vision for where they want to take the project is essential, if they ever want to
get it off the ground and in common use.
However, it is also arguably just as important for those of us who actually use the end product to
be able to offer our own perspective, experience, and ideas.
A project maintained alone can only survive so long, after all.

Without a new perspective every once in a while, many things get ignored or overlooked; it's
essential to be able to hear about the areas where the product falls short as well as the areas it
does well.
Without that, it becomes a never-ending minefield of guessing what will be valuable in the short
term as well as what is worthwhile pursuing in the long-term.

# The Selfish Selflessness Perspective

While it may not always be _voiced_, I can't help but feel that all too often I see people take the
attitude of _"well, it doesn't necessarily help me or what I'm doing; why should I bother?"_
Certainly, there may not always be a clear reason to contribute to an open source project.
It mightn't help you in your day to day _immediately_ with that specific tool, or you mightn't have
the necessary knowledge **right now** to make something happen that you'd like to see.

Even so, I think it's well worth your while to contribute as much as you're able to spare the time
for as a hobby.

## Reason 1: It helps the overall development of the project

You mightn't be able to contribute immensely to the core functionality of a tool, you mightn't even
be all that familiar with the language used to create the tool.
Even so, you can chip in and help out with a small amount of the "simpler" things, like:

* Low-priority issues
* Minor bugs
* Small quality-of-life improvements
* **Documentation**

I emphasize documentation because it's the easiest to neglect, but also one of the most important
things that affects the adoption of products as well as new features.

Helping out with these "less-important" but frequently overlooked "minor" things can really free up
other contributors and the project maintainers to be able to dedicate their time to the more
flashy and impressive new features or overhauls that _always_ take more time.
If they're always finding their time chipped away by having to constantly handle the small stuff,
they'll be caught in the uncomfortable place of either having to _ignore_ these issues entirely to
get that new feature completed (often to the detriment of documentation), or they'll have to forego
the necessary time investment to properly complete or even get any work done at all on the new
feature they've been trying to work on.

With even a handful of people helping chip away at the smaller issues, the ones that seem on the
surface to be "less important" no longer need take up time for everyone else who is contributing to
the project.
As a result, the project's development can be accelerated quite a bit just by a few people taking a
little time to jot down some documentation or tackle the relatively simpler fixes and minor issues.

## Reason 2: It helps you develop your own skills, or learn new ones

My first contribution to PowerShell Core was very much a trial by fire, as Patrick put it.
I was grumbling in the PowerShell [Discord](https://j.mp/psdiscord) server about how it was very
annoying that you can't specify named parameters for .NET methods in PowerShell, I think.

Enter Patrick, stage left (known widely as [@seeminglyscienc](https://twitter.com/seeminglyscienc)
on Twitter, and similarly [SeeminglyScience](https://github.com/SeeminglyScience) on Github) who
simply asked me "Why don't _you_ make it happen?"

Frankly, I was surprised.
I hadn't even _considered_ doing it myself &mdash; and I suspect I am not the only one out there who
simply hasn't even considered contributing.
That's part of the reason I'm writing this at all, really.

I knew I was out of my depth, but Patrick was keen to help me figure it out.
He gave me initial pointers, some places to start, and told me to send him a message if I got stuck.
In the interests of transparency, that idea _still_ hasn't really gotten anywhere.
It's still out of my depth a bit, but I'm confident now that given enough time to work on it and
sufficient guidance, I could absolutely make it happen.
It's a pet project that I've not yet found the time to complete just yet, but it's very much doable.
